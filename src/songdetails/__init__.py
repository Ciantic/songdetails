"""
Pure python package capable of retrieving song details from bunch of files
 
Usage example:
--------------

    >>> import songdetails
    >>> song = songdetails.scan("data/song.mp3")
    >>> if song is not None:
    ...     print song.duration
    0:03:12

Saving changes:

    >>> import songdetails
    >>> song = songdetails.scan("data/commit.mp3")
    >>> if song is not None:
    ...     song.artist = "Great artist"
    ...     song.save()
